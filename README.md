# WeatherForecast-MVVM
Overview
The Weather Forecast Android App is a simple yet powerful weather application that provides users with up-to-date weather information for their current location or any
location they choose. This app is built using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture and written in Kotlin. It leverages the OpenWeather API to fetch weather 
data and presents it to users in a user-friendly and intuitive interface.

Features
Current Weather: Get real-time weather information for your current location, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions.
Weather Forecast: View a 7-day weather forecast to plan your week ahead. This forecast includes daily temperature highs and lows, as well as a brief description of 
the weather conditions.
Search by Location: Enter any location to get weather information for that area. The app supports searching for cities worldwide.
Location-Based Data: The app automatically detects your current location and provides weather data for that location by default.
